# KRATE.Proof.of.Concept
This repo will be used to provide proof of concepts of our unique ideas using existing blockchain technology.

The first proof of concept will be version one of our Proof of Work algorithm.

Goals:

- Egalatarian PoW using a platform agnostic language and runtime
- Egalatarian PoW demonstrating either a near nil or absolute nil advantage for GPUs over CPUs
- PoW not susceptible to DDoS attacks by making proofs difficult to create but easy to validate


Please note that the proof of concepts may not use our core software. V1 of the PoW algorithm has been put into Stratis Full Node so we can start getting feedback on how it works on real hardware and if there are any platform issues we need to be aware of.
